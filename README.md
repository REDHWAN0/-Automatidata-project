# -Automatidata-project
Project Scenario:
The city's public transportation system is facing challenges. Bus routes are inefficient, leading to long wait times and overcrowding. This discourages ridership and increases reliance on private vehicles, contributing to traffic congestion and pollution. The city council needs a solution to optimize bus routes, improve on-time performance, and ultimately, encourage more residents to use public transportation.

## Skills demonstrated:
1- Python
2- Exploratory Data Analysis
3- Simulation Modeling
4- Tableau
5- Jupyter Notebook
 
## Summary:
This project aims to improve the city's bus system through data-driven route optimization. By analyzing ridership patterns, and traffic data, and leveraging GIS and simulation modeling techniques, we will develop efficient routes that reduce wait times, increase on-time performance, and ultimately entice more residents to choose public transportation.

## Solution:
Analyze ridership data, bus GPS locations, and traffic flow to identify areas with high demand, low ridership, and congestion.
Design new routes using GIS software, prioritizing efficiency, minimizing empty bus travel, and ensuring accessibility.
Implement optimized routes in phases after gathering public feedback through meetings and surveys.

## Approach:
Collect and analyze data on ridership, bus location, and traffic flow to understand usage patterns and identify inefficiencies.
Leverage GIS and simulation tools to design new routes and predict their impact on wait times, travel times, and passenger flow.
Collaborate with communities throughout the process to gather feedback and ensure the new routes meet their needs.
